# RnB-Wavelet - EEG spectroscopy

## Description

Current methodologies (Wen & Liu,2016; Donoghue et al.,2020) rely on the Fourier analysis and are limited to disentangling the rhythmic and arrhythmic activities from the Fourier spectral power.

The RnB (rhythms and background)-Wavelet model shifts this paradigm by using discrete wavelet analysis, allowing the separation of these components at the temporal level of a signal. 

The algorithm extracts a ‘rhythmic signal’ by filtering out the arrhythmic components from the wavelet coefficients.
