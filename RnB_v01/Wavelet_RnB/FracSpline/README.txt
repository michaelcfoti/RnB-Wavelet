FRACTIONAL SPLINE WAVELET SOFTWARE FOR MATLAB (RESTRICTED HERE in 1D)Thierry BluThe Chinese University of Hong KongJune 2014A. TEST PROGRAMSDEMO1D: Demonstration program that exemplifies the use of the 1D Fractional Spline Wavelet transform         and the associated helper functionsB. CORE WAVELET TRANSFORM FUNCTIONSFFTFRACTSPLINEFILTERS: Computes the frequency responses of the wavelet analysis and synthesis filters (lowpass and highpass) for various types ('ortho','bspline','dual') of orthonormal or semi-orthonormal fractional spline wavelet transforms, and for various parameters (alpha,tau)  as described in Ref. [3].FFTWAVELETANALYSIS1D : Performs an FFT-based computation of the 1D wavelet transform of a signal to a given depth J.FFTWAVELETSYNTHESIS1D: Performs an FFT-based computation of the 1D inverse wavelet transform.C. OTHER ROUTINESWEXTRACT1D   : Extraction of a subband of a 1D wavelet transform.WAVELETPLOT1D: Show the 1D wavelet transform as several staged plots.FRACTSPLINEFUNCTION       : Computes a scaling function with the input (alpha,tau) parametersFRACTSPLINEWAVELETFUNCTION: Computes a wavelet function with the input (alpha,tau) parametersFRACTSPLINEAUTOCORR: Frequency domain computation of fractional spline autocorrelation function.References:[1] Unser, M. & Blu, T.,"Fractional Splines and Wavelets", SIAM Review, Vol. 42 (1), pp. 43-67, March 2000. [2] Blu, T. & Unser, M.,"The Fractional Spline Wavelet Transform: Definition and Implementation", Proc.
